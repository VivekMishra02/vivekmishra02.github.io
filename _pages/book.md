<p>I decided to write this book because when I began filing patents, I noticed a gap in available literature. Existing books either focused solely on the legal aspects of patenting or provided guidelines on generating ideas and innovations. What was missing was a practical example demonstrating how to design an innovative solution for specific problem statements within risk-sensitive domains, particularly in enterprise data storage from an <b>Inventor's perspective</b>.</p>

<p>Despite the existence of only four books on Conformal Prediction as listed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_prediction#Books" target="_blank">Wikipedia (Conformal prediction)</a>), I recognized the need for a fifth book that would approach the topic from an <b>inventor's perspective</b>, rather than from an academic theory or industrial applications.</p>

<p>Over the course of 18 months, I collaborated closely with the University of California, Berkeley, and the Co-Founder of Boodh Inc (who are also co-author of the Book) to complete this comprehensive Book.</p>

<p>You can also request a <b>FREE copy of the Book</b> (only for personal use) if you are currently a Student. All you have to do is sent me an email requesting for a copy of the book usign your student email with .edu domain (this is the only way to conform you are a student).</p>
