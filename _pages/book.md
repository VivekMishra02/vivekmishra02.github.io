  <h2>Design Patterns for AI Agents: A Structured Approach to Building Robust and Intelligent Systems</h2>
  <p>
    I wrote this book because I noticed a gap in how beginners understand AI agents.
    Based on my own experience learning and working with them, I wanted to create something
    that makes these concepts clearer and more accessible.
