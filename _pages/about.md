Rahul Vishwakarma is a Graduate Student in Computer Science and working as a research assistant in the domain of Machine Learning at Computer Architecture, Reliability, and Security Laboratory (CARS-Lab), California State University Long Beach. His thesis focus on designing storage security for wearable devices and mitigating attacks from evolving hardware trojans.

He brings expertise in applied machine learning leveraging statistical and deep learning approaches focusing on uncertainity quantification. [GitHub: Awesome Conformal Prediction](https://github.com/valeman/awesome-conformal-prediction).

Currently, he is working on causality aware time series classification and probabilistic inference for Hemodialysis undere the supervision of [Dr. James C. Leiter](https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=186) and [Mahshid Fardadi](https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/fellowship-recipients/fellows-pages/fardadi-mahshid.html). 

He worked as a Software Engineer at Dell Technologies (formerly EMC2), where he drove solutions for Data Protection and helped customers protect their data with Data Domain (de-duplication based backup storage), leveraging machine learning across the product stack. He has been recognized as one of the top US Patent filers across APJ, EMEA, and LATAM (Latin America) for two consecutive years FY20 and FY21, and has received the prestigious Milestone Award at Dell Technologies. The U.S. Patent 11,513,931 (issued November 29, 2022) has been implemented in Dell Power Protect Data Domain. 
Prior to this, he worked at Hewlett Packard Enterprise where he designed HPE ConvergedSystem for SAP HANA reference architecture. He loves solving challenging problems across interdisciplinary domains.

He holds a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from SRM University, India (2009).
