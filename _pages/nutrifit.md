## Artifact 1: NutriFit AI – Smart Fitness and Nutrition Chatbot

### Overview
**NutriFit AI** is an interactive chatbot that combines fitness and nutrition guidance into a single conversational interface. It helps users understand the nutritional value of their meals, get personalized workout recommendations, and develop healthier habits. The goal of this project was to make fitness tracking feel as natural as chatting with a virtual personal coach.

### My Role
I focused on designing and refining the conversational logic of the chatbot using **Chatbase.co**. My work included evaluating AI-generated responses, comparing different conversational strategies, and improving the overall quality and tone of the chatbot’s interaction with users.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Chatbase.co** – for chatbot creation and training  
- **OpenAI LLMs** – for conversational modeling  
- **Data sources:** USDA nutrition datasets, MyFitnessPal, and peer feedback  
- **Collaboration tools:** Google Workspace, PowerPoint, and GitHub  

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Applying AI/ML concepts to real-world health and fitness problems  
- Designing conversational AI interfaces  
- Analyzing and improving user engagement and response quality  
- Collaborating in a multi-disciplinary team  

### Outcome
The final chatbot delivers **personalized exercise and nutrition guidance** through an accessible and engaging conversational experience. It demonstrates my ability to combine technical AI skills with human-centered design principles.

## Reflection

Working on the NutriFit AI chatbot was my first hands-on experience merging artificial intelligence with real-world wellness applications. The project challenged me to think critically about how people interact with AI systems and how those systems can provide meaningful, personalized support.  
Through this work, I learned how to train and evaluate chatbot models, interpret user feedback, and iterate quickly to improve conversational design. More importantly, I developed confidence in explaining complex AI processes in simple, practical terms.  
This artifact represents my growth as a developer who values **practical, user-focused AI solutions** and who can bridge the gap between technology and human behavior.

## Reflection
Creating this Prezi helped me strengthen my communication and visualization skills—two critical areas for any AI/ML professional. It taught me how to translate complex algorithms and data-driven ideas into visuals and language that anyone can understand.  
This project complements my earlier artifact (NutriFit AI) by showing a different strength: not building an AI model, but explaining it clearly and persuasively to others. It reflects my ability to connect technical understanding with storytelling and user engagement.


## About This Portfolio
This portfolio highlights my ongoing journey in **AI and Machine Learning**, showcasing key projects and reflections from my coursework and professional experiences. Each artifact reflects specific skills and milestones in applying AI tools to solve real-world problems.
