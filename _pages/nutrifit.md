## Artifact 1: NutriFit AI – Smart Fitness and Nutrition Chatbot

### Overview
**NutriFit AI** is an interactive chatbot that combines fitness and nutrition guidance into a single conversational interface. It helps users understand the nutritional value of their meals, get personalized workout recommendations, and develop healthier habits. The goal of this project was to make fitness tracking feel as natural as chatting with a virtual personal coach.

### My Role
I focused on designing and refining the conversational logic of the chatbot using **Chatbase.co**. My work included evaluating AI-generated responses, comparing different conversational strategies, and improving the overall quality and tone of the chatbot’s interaction with users.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Chatbase.co** – for chatbot creation and training  
- **OpenAI LLMs** – for conversational modeling  
- **Data sources:** USDA nutrition datasets, MyFitnessPal, and peer feedback  
- **Collaboration tools:** Google Workspace, PowerPoint, and GitHub  

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Applying AI/ML concepts to real-world health and fitness problems  
- Designing conversational AI interfaces  
- Analyzing and improving user engagement and response quality  
- Collaborating in a multi-disciplinary team  

### Outcome
The final chatbot delivers **personalized exercise and nutrition guidance** through an accessible and engaging conversational experience. It demonstrates my ability to combine technical AI skills with human-centered design principles.
