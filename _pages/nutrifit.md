### Tools and Technologies
- **Chatbase.co** – for chatbot creation and training  
- **OpenAI LLMs** – for conversational modeling  
- **Data sources:** USDA nutrition datasets, MyFitnessPal, and peer feedback  
- **Collaboration tools:** Google Workspace, PowerPoint, and GitHub  

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Applying AI/ML concepts to real-world health and fitness problems  
- Designing conversational AI interfaces  
- Analyzing and improving user engagement and response quality  
- Collaborating in a multi-disciplinary team
